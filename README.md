## Parsing a JSON object.
This module provides functionality for parsing a JSON object (a list or a dictionary in Python). As a result of running a program, the user gets the value of a particular field of that object.
## Installation
To be able to parse a JSON, clone this repository and run the code on your computer.
## Usage
First, run the program on your computer. Then enter a path to a .json file and follow the prompts, entering either the number of the element you'd like to be displayed (if your object is a Python list), or one of the available keys (if your object is a Python dictionary).
